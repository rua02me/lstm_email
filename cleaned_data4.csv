Re:,'sent mail,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike

Re: The New Power Company,'sent mail,"Scott,

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Re: Unocal WAHA Storage,'sent mail,"Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

represent all the risk held by the desk

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if 
you want to change from printing vertically 
to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want 
your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview
to see what your print out will look like before you print.

daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and

I am sending the Dr. a contract for Monday delivery.  He is offering
$739,000 with $73,900 down.

He wants us to finish the work on the units that are being renovated now.
We need to specify those units in the contract.  We also need to specify the
units that have not been remodeled.  I think he will be a good buyer.  He is
a local with plenty of cash.  Call me after you get this message.

Per your and Jeff's request, Research and Market Risk Groups have conducted 
an extensive analysis of the forward-forward vol methodology used in the 
Value-at-Risk calculation. 

We analyzed and compared two methodologies: 

 the existing methodology - based on forward (implied) vols
 an alternative methodology - based on historical vols

I would like to schedule about 30 minutes to walk you through the pros and 
cons of each methodology and get your input.

Re:,'sent mail,"most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

Re: Monday Conference Call,'sent mail,"Mike:
Two questions regarding fees:
1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type 
investment into the hedge funds?
2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.  
However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that 
Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?

Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber 
is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my 
above-market returns compromised by high fees.

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a

A note on PMA's,'sent mail,"You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of

I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions 
on EOL ""Force Majeure"" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon 
Katy Plant and were wondering the ""Force Majeure"" ramifications of the the 
Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that 
instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?  
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool 
and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these 
pooling zones.  

I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this

Eric,

Counterparty would like to see volume as 910,000/mo rather than 29355/day, 
due to the 5 MMBtu discrepancy our volume causes.  Can you adjust TAGG to the 
per month volume?

Thanks,

Excerpt from an article on espn.com

Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and

                  ousting Mumme was a mandatory move. The school's image is 
too fragile to
                  countenance keeping a coach with major violations on his

Re: Debate,'sent mail,"What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job 
- mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool 
of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think 
that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the ""wealthiest one percent"".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, 
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.

my predicament at running back will last me one week, maybe two.  I think 
that i have a good enough team to withstand a bad start and make it to the 
playoffs anyway.  I don't value people by what round they are picked in.  
Engram was easily in my top 30 or 25 recievers while shroeder was barely in 
my top 50.  Raymont Harris has been out of football for a while, and is on a 
team that won't run the ball much.  This move would maybe help my team the 
first week, but it wouldn't help me in the long run.  So the answer is no

Program Changes,'sent mail,"Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

will follow up with him next week.

Cindy Olson said you'd be a good person to talk with on this subject, as

I'm doing some research on the ASE and whether to create something internally

and which would be the aspects we'd discard.?
Can I get 15-30 minutes of your time to discuss in the next week or two?

Sally,

Per Catherine at Travel Agency in the Park, bulkhead seats were all that were 
available when she booked flight 3 or 4 weeks ago.  Says those particular 
flights have gotten quite popular lately.  Only other option for return:

Same isle (E)
 - Row 8 (also bulkhead, but maybe not as noisy)
 - Last row window seat (doesn't recline as much as other seats)

If you like either of these better that existing seat, let me know & I change 
it.

infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given 
the possible recovery of this sector?

cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than

Re: EES Organizational Changes,'sent mail,"Scott, I apologize that no one talked to you before this one went out.  I 
assumed that Marty or Dan had spoken to you as we discussed this initial 
change; however, I take full responsibility.  I will guarantee it won't 
happen again.  My understanding is that you have been a significant 
contributor to EES strategy and success.  You can count on a lot more 
discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you 
will be leading a market opportunity.  I have asked Kay to set up some time 
for us to discuss the market and the future next week.  If that is not soon 
enough, I am around all day today.

Technical Services,'sent mail,"John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks 
into his central Technical Services group.  These folks would continue to 
work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the 
centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors 
including NEPCO and OEC.  It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican 
business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development 
risk.  Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.

ENA Offsite 2000,'sent mail,"Beth, can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite.  You 
have approximately one hour.  Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan 
(ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe 
your view of where we need to go in the future.  I would leave some time for 
questions.

The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good 
understanding of what is our systems agenda for ENA in 2001.

Could you have a first cut by December 8th?

Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting.

Kay, I do not approve of the limo charge for Laura Luce's housekeeper. Laura 
needs to either write her own personal check for this or deduct the charge 
against her next expense report. It is imperative that this does not slip 
through the cracks. Since Laura no longer reports to me, Dave should handle. 
Thanks for being so diligent in looking into this.

Dave, we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$45MM tax loss 
to offset our year-end projected C$50MM Taxable Income position. By doing 
this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems 
to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are 
meeting with Wes on Tuesday to discuss further but I thought that I should 
keep you in the loop as it is a significant transaction that you may want on 
your radar screen for your discussions with Wes.

My idea would be to confirm that appropriate due diligence has been done. Has 
the mid-year performance evaluation been reviewed? Has his two direct 
supervisors been contacted (Ozzie Pagan and Gil Muhl) for specific input into 
this? Once all this has been confirmed and everyone has agreed, you should 
make a decision to either re-deploy him to another area or offer him a 
severence package. 

My recommendation would be to have him in a coverage role in Southeast gas.

I am doing some research on historical prices in surrounding power markets 
and I am trying to determine the wholesale market-opening dates for NE power 
markets. I am also interested in dates when locational marginal pricing (LMP) 
was implemented (if at all).

I was able to get dates for every market but Cinergy and ECAR. Please let me 
know if you can tell me who to contact, and/or if someone in Houston can dig 
this up for me.

I don't mean to be a burden, but Jeff Borg was hoping I could come up with 
this for a 3:00pm meeting today.

Thanks bro,

Dan

Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the delivery period

Vacation,'sent mail,"BH,

I plan to be on vacation July 5-6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the 
7th.  While I am out, Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during 
trading.  Stacey will be in charge of everything else.  I am comfortable that 
everything will be covered.  

I will be back in town Thursday night.  The primary flight for the customer 
trip leaves around 11:30.  Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).   The latest 
idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will 
take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the

the first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process 
of being shut in.  We purchased the gas from Torch-Rally Partnership in 
Sept.  Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers?

Please advise.

Daren,

I have 2 allocation exceptions that require a deal to be extended.  Meter 
98-1488 Tenaska is showing small volumes flowed on days there was no deal.  
Can you extend the deal throughout the month so that the volumes will have a 
deal to link to.    I have the same situation on meter 98-1601.

If you have any questions, please let  me know.

Thanks,

Please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter.  I 
am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect. In POPS, the estimates vs 
acutals look odd.  The gas that was coming to us in June, is going to Koch in 
July, so we should not be receiving anything.

If you review that deal in CPR, you can see that this is a desk to desk deal 
on ECT.  This is actually our transport of Waha gas on PGE, delivered into 
HPL.  So, the volume should be scheduled/allocated to the ECT intrastate

FYI

Daren---On the 12th, there is a sale to Aquila on the Header system, for 
10,000........I think we were supplying it with AEC.  For whatever reason, I 
had the AEC 10.0 @ #11230 into Midcon...which isnt right because there was no 
market for it, and Midcon wasnt looking for it, but the Aquila deal was at 
#700 on WGR (Aquila).  So I went ahead and changed the AEC ticket to match up 
with the Aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.

00.     Should this deal have had some volume on it.
It was never scheduled with volume  however, in January it received flow of 
3461 due to ranking in POPS.  It was taken to zero once the actuals came in.

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is ""Energy curtailed"" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message ""Turbine Com Established"" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a ""Energy 
curtailed"" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded?

Here is a sample of the output for this request. For this I have only used 
May 2002. I for the boxplots one has had records removed when the ambient and 
gearbox temp is less than 0 (I can provide turbines and times if needed). 
There were many records where this occured. There were also 5 records where 
the Gearbox temp was over 100 and these were also removed. All of these over 
100 records occured on turbine 105 on May 1st between 1640 and 1740 (UTC).

WR613 Pitch System Performance (Energy),'sent mail,"Tom,

I have energy estimates for May 2002 attached. Graph 1 is site totals, graph 
2 is (total lost)/(total actual production) where total actual production is 
taken from the kWh reported in the owner report, and graph 3 is the by 
turbine distribution (using box plots) of energy lost. 

The energy lost estimation method I employed is susceptible to problems with 
data recovery (10-minute data), which in May 2002 was especially poor at 
Klondike and Fenner, so those number are not as informative as those for the 
other sites. 

If these graphs provide you the information you need, I will continue with 
the remaining months (Jan - Apr). Otherwise let me know and we'll refine this

I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto 
(by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf),

Drew,

I pulled TW San Juan (Blanco) prices off the RDI database for January 1, 1998 
through June 8, 2000 (the most current in the database).  If you need to have 
the remainder of June and the first part of July input, let me know.  The

Mock Trial,'sent mail,"Here's a thought that didn't occur to me when I marked up the mock trial

Busters""???  Unless we are pretty sure the judge will keep it out on

it.  With or without the specific IPEC Busters stuff, we probably ought to 
assume that Jad's theme will be that Northern's whole philosophy was to 
breach contracts without flinching if it served our commercial interests.  
The vitriol from P&P and the other producers plays into that theme.  Maybe we 
ought to spice that part of the script up a bit also just so we can see how 
our response plays.  DF",694

Attached is my analysis based on a sales price of $14.2MM and $14.8MM with a 
buy back in the 7th year.  The loan structure for Hanover assumes that the 
difference between the sales price and TW's buy back price would be amortized 
over the contract term.  The remaining balance of the loan is assumed to be a 
balloon payment at the end of the finance term.

I will put together some analysis on a 9 year term and forward this on to you 
when it is completed.

and get all volumes scheduled daily.

NWPL:  we were able to manually input 80% of next days nominations.  Since we

nominations for the day, as well as all actual scheduled volumes in Unify.  
We were also only able to get in our 80% of nominations with NWPL's help, as 
they extended the nomination deadline for us.  The other 20% of next day 
business will be nominated as an intra-day.

El Paso:  basically the same as NWPL..  We were able to manually get in 100% 
of nominations, but only because El Paso kept their system open an extra hour

Here are the details:

Location:  7126-NFUL/TRCO LEIDY TRANSCO

  transport demand charge(4/2000)    = $56,078.82


Deal   227196 purchase 9189/day @ NX1 + .22 (3.12)    

Deal  219618 sell              6000/day @ Michcon Citygate G.D. M.I. + 
.39(3.39) 

It seems as though ENA is recouping the demand charge only on 6,000 mmbtu per

Subject: CGAS K# 39764 - Deal #77349

The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the 
information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling 
so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the 
pipeline?

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges 
that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb.
Are you working on getting contracts and deals added?

Thanks,

Just a note that as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how

Hi,'sent mail,"Here is what I have so far.   One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi 
Carter.  His number is 713-853-5580.

I learned some things today.  Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2 
companies New Boston Technologies (713-626-4900) and Comsys (713-547-0700).  
Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not 
make them an offer.

Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him.

But, I'm thinking I should at least know your name first.  

Also, we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat 
with.

I get you more scoop later.",580

Chris,
Most companies send us their fixed-price bidweek data in this format. It's 
more
accurate since we just have to transfer the data instead of retyping 
everything
into our master database. It also saves time on days like today when we have 
to
turn everything over in a day. Anyone with questions can give me a call --

Found this on a web site.


The Gelaendewagen or ""G-wagen"" is something of a Land Rover on steroids with 
German engineering. 
Think of a cross between an S500 sedan and the Hummer. At $135,000 a copy and 
with only a handful being 
imported into the US, those lucky enough to get their hands on a G-Wagen are 
assured exclusivity and an 
all-terrain vehicle that means business.

by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel 
as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's

W4,'sent mail,"A W4 calculates how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck each pay 
period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing 
status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married 
and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There 
is really no right or wrong answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld 
each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on 
April 15th, then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately.  If you 
don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you 
may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and

The Sitara numbers for both of these deals are in the comments section of

OA,'sent mail,"Jeff,
I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us 
involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking 
deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last 
one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small 
and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I 
think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in 
preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is 
easier said than done.

for the game (if you want to call it a game).  We ended up staying at a

Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field
Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in

Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg
Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal
Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for

New Sitara Books for EOL,'sent mail,"Stephanie,

We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 
1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid 
Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could 
have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but 
all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders 
involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.

 Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South
 Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this 
request.  Thanks for your help.

I know  0.5  (thousand) were granted by the NG Price, but I could not fine

Pasadena,'sent mail,"We need to make certain that the transport  for Pasdena is booked properly in

to them at the border.  Please run a minibook of the transaction thru the 
remaining term and let me review it.  Please let me know when this has been 
fixed.  

Kim, what is the cost of the transport for the month of May?  Did we roll the

New Socal and PG&E products,'sent mail,"We have created the new southern border index products for Socal and PG&E

products as well.  Let the brokers know about the new indices  I have the 
back office setting up new curves to book these deals.  You will have two 
curves for Socal now.  The curves will show your risk on the old index, as 
well as the new index.  The new Socal index is the same as the old except 
that excludes KRS.  

I will be taking these phys products out on EOL as soon as possible.

Basis trading,'sent mail,"Frank,

The new procedures for trading basis are working well.  We still need to get 
the desk comfortable with submitting orders to you guys, but overall I am 
pleased with the new procedure.    I need to work on staying out of the basis 
market entirely going forward. Can you also try to work all basis at Socal 
through Keith.  Let Keith and Mo see all of your Socal/Malin spreads in the 
future.  I think I gave you an order to work Apr-Oct 02 socal/malin at the 
same time Keith was trying to sell a-o 02 socal basis.  I will let him know 
in the future so that we do not cross him in the market.

100% SJ,'sent mail,"Let's start thinking about transitioning SJ to 100% flow.  I would like to 
discuss all of the issues and costs of presenting such a product to the 
market.  Think about what we might need in the form of Northwest transport, 
storage, operations personnel, etc.  I realize that this will be risky and 
that I may experience some financial downside with this endeavor, but I think 
we should press forward.  Will we need intra-day traders to place the gas?  
Do we need to establish intra-day relationships with SJ producers, utilities, 
etc?  Will the allocation on EL Paso in April alleviate some of the cuts?

Let's discuss in detail.

all new deals that flow through the desk.  She can coordinate tickets to your

accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day.  You 
can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed.

Changes to Financial settlements for CA,'sent mail,"We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from 
Southern California Border average.  This new index excludes KRS fixed priced 
trades.  Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going 
forward.  Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.

Also,  Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for  
southern border, PG&E.  This will be the index for PG&E Topock.  This index 
will be effective for April 2001.  I will have the physical product out there

they gave me.  The numbers appeared good and there were no problems for those 
hours.  Apparently this also happened to Holden earlier on 12/23.  I also had

transmission deal for 15MW HE 1-24 and used the normal pac transmission 
price.  I am not sure if this is correct or how this should eactly be 
handled.  I will be on break from the 24th thru the 30 so if you could fix

with Joe at  IID they stated that  they spoke with Tony at 14:13 PST and told 
him to put in 120 for HE 17 and 18 MST.  I agreed to check out with their 
number as it appears that there was a miscommunication between IID, Tony,

he comes in if he recalls this conversation.  Thank you for your attention to

in the disputed Idaho deal.  They stated that they could not do that.  They 
were very nice about it an stated that they have problems with Idaho quite 
often but they had to turn away several customers during that hour and would 
not be able to add our schedule.  I have deleted the deals from enpower and I 
have deleted them from the El Paso sheet however, I did not do a final

Cuts at NOB,'sent mail,"Group,

Yesterday 11 /11 and this morning  11/12  the ISO cut one of our schedules 
where Enron was exporting from SP 15, to NOb more specifically the schedule 
looks like this: CISO-EPMI-SCL. Per Sean Crandall starting tomorrow and 
forward we will not allow the ISO to cut our schedules UNTIL  all the OTHER 
nonfirm schedules are cut FIRST. This is made possible by new FTRs that Chris 
Mallory scheduled on the Sp/NOB path. 

As a result of having firm transmission rights If the ISO calls and cuts one 
of our schedules at NOB we need to make sure  and ask the ISO that the other 
nonfirm  schedules are cut first then we can accept our cut. 

For any further questions on this matter contact Sean Crandall or Chris 
MAllory

CISO to WWP       681713
CISO to SCL         882790
CISO to Tacoma 882791

I realize these counterparties can pick up at malin however, I thought it 
would be useful to have these accounts set up in case they are unable or 
unwilling to pick up at Malin. Also I have added an account number for 
Turlock to SCL.  SCL has been willing to do Buy/Resales from their system to 
Malin recently and this should be useful given that Snohomish has recently 
been unwilling to do so.
 
TURLOCK to SCL  790612

Tucson Electric Power Co. v. Governor Davis and PX,'sent mail,"On Tuesday, Tucson filed a complaint against the Power Exchange and Governor 
Davis, arguing that the FERC should render null and void the unconditional 
transfer of SCE and PG&E's block forward contracts.  It argues that such a 
transfer requires prior FERC approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power 
Act and should be conditioned by FERC to protect the public interest.  It 
also argues that FERC should order the PX to enforce its tariff, by requiring 
the PX to immediately collect from PG&E and SCE all monies due for wholesale 
sales to date.

(Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU 
forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX

possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates the banking 
provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).  These provisions requires the PX to 
hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.  Second, these are 
wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent

Reporting out-of-market transactions,'sent mail,"Based on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market

Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was 
not artfully written.  Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information 
necessary for refunds.
We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more 
liquid.  As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals 
will not be achieved.

Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New
Course as a backup.  You may want to double check with the Pro Shop.  Thank
you again.  Please meeting you via e-mail.

Business Review,'sent mail,"After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.

Power Plant Model,'sent mail,"Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.

Hi, Vince:

My name is Eugene Zeitz, and I work for EES Gas Desk. We have some questions 
concerning hedging of options. Usually, we address such questions to Krishna, 
but he is out until Jan 21, and we need some help. 

Would it be possible for you to give us 1 hour of your time, or, perhaps, you 
could recommend someone?


           Thanks.



             Eugene.

John,

In general, results are not too different from last day roll.    For ""no 
roll"" and ""roll same position"" strategies, the 2nd last day seems to 
outperform slightly more often.

Let me know if you would like to 
1) look at quarter to quarter earning volatility of these strategies or
2) look at effect of incorporating some transaction costs for 
rolling/liquidating positions.

I am with the EBS Venture Capital group. We are looking at evaluating an 
investment in a company called Widevine out of Seattle. Part of their value 
proposition involves certain patents on genetic programming. Are you familiar 
with that? If so, can I set a meeting with you and a few other members of my

Stinson,

I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
large
and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
those trade earning the half of BO spread. 

I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
are 
ready to deliever the model V.1.

The next step is to incorporate the intra-day market movement by using high 
and low
prices into the pricing.  I will call you on Monday.

Happy Thanksgivings !

Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase

Hi everyone,

 before Grant leaves Houston, I wanted to have a small get-together at my 
house for dinner.  Since everybody is very busy, I want to schedule a date 
well in advance, so I am suggesting Saturday, Dec 2.  This will be dinner 
with family.  Please let me know if this works for you.

Yaron's Resume,'sent mail,"Charlene,

the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a

I have received two additional  requests for help from EES.

I need some publicly available data that  unfortunately is not available

futures contracts and options.
?
Again the data is strictly public info and not  proprietary at all.? Let me 
know if there is a central data person at Enron  who would be able to help.? 
All help will be of course gratefully  acknowledged.

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy

you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and

Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer. Clayton 
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on. Vasant will formulate 
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold  Clayton  to it. If he fails to deliver the request for 
transfer will be rejected. Anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody.

Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) 
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be

Thanks for your help on content for EOL phase 2.

An additional piece of content that we are trying to include in our scope is 
an options calculator.  This would be an interactive tool to teach less 
sophisticated counterparties about options.  We would like to collaborate 
with someone in research to refine our approach (and make sure we're using 
the right formulas).  Who should we contact in research for this?

Attached is a mock-up of what we have in mind...

Shalesh,'sent mail,"Jim,

Clarification regarding Shalesh' transfer to EBS.

The request to rotate Shalesh out of Research into EBS
came from Ravi Thuraisingham. My understanding was that it was
fully coordinated with you and I was more than happy to oblige.

Shalesh is concerned that his integrity is being questioned and I can assure
you that he was not the instigator of the move.

My impression is that Shalesh is doing a very good job and Ravi is very happy
him. I shall be glad to keep him in the Research Group in his current role.

Have a good 4th of July.

Re: Storage story,'sent mail,"John,

Very interesting, I would make a point that the generation demand
is highly volatile  and driven to a large extent by weather. Also,
the changes in the structure of gas demand
require development of different types of storage (more peaking storage).

Iraq and Crude Output,'sent mail,"An interesting piece of information from the oil markets. 
Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down
production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).

The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst).
He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations.
He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in
his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the
oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and 
transparency of
the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by

Here is my working paper on the issue. We actually applied the alternative 
method
(put value) to the calculation of premium for managing the ""liquidation 
value"" curves.

I am working with the desk to get a list of all the projects we have with 
information about 
the technology class, region, volume etc. Shortly we will be able to apply 
these methodologies
and test them.

Re: SPSS request for Iris,'sent mail,"Vasant,

I have approved Iris' request for SPSS (reluctantly).
It makes sense for her to use SPSS when she works 
for London (it would require more effort
to move data bet the systems than the cost
of SPSS).

I don't like proliferation of systems, however.

Hi Vince,

 is it fine to approve SPSS for Iris (cost $499), or should we ask that she 
use SAS, for which we already have a site license?  The only reason to use 
SPSS is because I think London people use it (I am not sure about this).

I'll send you the DASH that was done previously for the used LNG tanker, the 
Mystic Lady (now renamed as the Hoegh Galleon).  The analysis used in this 
transaction was not detailed due the short time-frame we had to analyze this 
transaction as well as to Enron's right to terminate this charter for 
convenience.

We are presently working on the analysis for a second, new-build LNG tanker.  
When this analysis has progressed far enough that we have a draft DASH, I 
will forward it to you (this may be later this week).

Vince - attached is the most recent E&P version of the old corporate cash 
flow model that I could find.  Note that ""most recent"" still dates it back a 
few years.  A couple caveats:  I did try to clean it up somewhat from old 
macros, but no guarntees offered.  Also, some of the underlying methodology 
is not what we would probably currently use, such as for pricing, stochastic 
processes, and perhaps decline rates.  
Please let me know if I can provide any additional help.

forward to lunch one day soon at Brennans.

Wayne Tow is a brilliant man, He worked for many years for a man I know
well.  This man says, Wayne is as good as it get, and he could do
anything that is assigned to him, and do it at  a level in which he was
always amazed.
He loves the E-commerce area, and this is what he wants to do
Thank you, Vince.

Vince,

A few weeks ago we talked about installing an additional Bloomberg terminal 
on the 31st floor for Mike's weather team.
 I have submitted a security request, and we are now waiting for your 
approval.  
Could you, please, go over that request and give Mike Roberts and me your

Chicago options,'sent mail,"Richard,

After going throught the numbers on this peaker. I can only pay 4-5 cents for 
a 10 day peaker at Chicago. That would be a net payment to you of 
$604,000. 

You are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and I will pay 10% of the 
underlying price to get the optionality.  As a relative value NYZ6 or Socal 
is worth much more.  Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest 
out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too 
liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.  

Call me to go over the numbers if you want

Subject: Newsprint Stats & Note on EOL/Clickpaper

John,

FYI Clickpaper should be up and running by the end of the month.  We will be 
quoting mostly the same products as we currently do in EOL (except longer 
term and one new physical offering).  We will also continue to make quotes on 
EOL but probably with a wider spread.

Some newsprint stuff for you.  As with any other commodity, the inventories 
and operating rate/capacity are the key drivers.

Emmisions,'sent mail,"The Emmisions book under Kevin McGowan will take a one time $4 Million hit 
today.  This is to move the curves to better reflect the current market.  
This hit will stay in the Coal group but will be removed from its P/L from a 
performance measurement standpoint.  Now that the curves are corrected I 
expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following 
ways:

1.  Understanding the fundamentals.
2.  Taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast.
3.  Building more liquidity and being the primary market maker.
4.  Developing new traders.

Re: Canadian Nukes,'sent mail,"Jim

This information on Ontario nukes is similar to our information. The only 
difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four 
Pickering units (500 mw each) would come back in 2001 (although optimistic) 
followed by one each year after that.  Your report says that all Pickering 
units would come back in 2001.  Even in your report, however, they seem 
doubtful that this is realistic.  The Bruce Units (3000 mw) appear to be dead 
for a long time if not for good.

The FRED file for Ontario did not include flashed liquidations detail.  It 
appears the files were not prepared by risk.  I have prepared the files and 
attached them.  Do you mind including this in the FRED file and reissuing?

Okay, I've been working on the Settlements forms and I've updated the 
schedules again.  There were some adjustments to the Fred variances as well 
when I reclassed liquidations out of financial and into physical.  Since I'm 
pretty much out of time, here is the latest, and most likely, final, schedule:

Re: 7/00 Sithe Financial Liquidations,'sent mail,"Please use the following two files as your detail support for finanical 
liquidations:


Previously, I believe you were given the capacity hedges file the 
pricebasisindex file and the pricebasisindex_revised file.  All three of 
these equalled the 3.7 million.  You should use the revised and the capacity 
hedge file.  When you use the two files listed above, you will come up with a 
variance going the other way of roughly $(817,385).  This amount should be a 
""desk adjustment"".  We have accounted for the variance in our current month 
(0800) file and will simply reclass between the months.  Please shout with

Attached is the liquidation support for July.  I am still in the process of 
tying these deals to the General Ledger and currently the difference is 
sitting in the Texas Region as the problem is most likely related to the 
financial deals on Co. 12.  Please do your research as usual and I will give 
you a detailed list of any changes if it relates to your region.

How are the wedding plans going?  Good I hope.  Have you adjusted to the new

everything works out.  That was probably the most difficult thign for us.  

Have you been keeping up with the Astros?  They look absolutely horrible.

AC arrived around 200am today, weighing in at 7 1/4 lbs, 19 inches.  All are 
fine, with the exception of Papa, who suffered a slightly bruised ego when he 
fainted around 205.  As Carlos mentioned in his voice mail ""the women were 
quite amused"".  The syncope episode was attributed to a hot delivery room.  

Right.

Anyway, I don't intend to communicate with Carlos about the Delta deal.  He 
has his hands full.

Talk to you later today,

I don't remember if I told you I will be home for spring break. Danielle
wants us to go somewhere on our way home (she says Schlitterbahn, but I'm

Ashley has mentioned possibly going to her river house maybe on Thursday,
but no matter what, I'll be home for a good chunk of spring break. Just

Deerfield development agreement,'sent mail,"Here are my initial comments:

There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval 
process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re 
landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the 
effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building 
permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the 
time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.

Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for 
the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other 
than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to 
obtain project financing.

Hi there,

I'm forwarding a draft EPC contract for your review.  This form of contract 
assumes that the equipment will be procurred by the Owner, with the 
understanding that we have not resolved the issue of the timing of the 
procurement of the equipment, and  how it will be procurred.

This is intended to be a discussion draft, and is subject to further Enron 
review and comment.  

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack) I 
would like to purchase those.

Do you mind checking to see if you have 2 tickets for March 1 (Def Leppard), 
if you do I would like to purchase those also.

Just let me know.

Thanks so much!

If the transformer contract will be assigned later to a wholly owned sub of

Same thought on the GE override.  This is because the override will still be

Re: Revised Closing Checklist (Intergen Transaction),'sent mail,"Team Turbineb,

Number one priority is the amendment to the two letter agreements.  We are 
also trying to get the ABB and GE facility agreements finalized so they can 
be tendered to Intergen today.  

Meanwhile, on the TurboPark front I am revising the relevant documents so the 
drafts can be sent to the banks today.  Once the assignment and assumption 
agreement form is approved, it will need to be signed by GE.  This doesn't 
have to be done today.

I'm on the phone with GE.  Their initial response to the assignment stuff is 
positive.  They want a letter which sets out the ownership of the LLC and 
what we are doing on payment.

I've been working on TECO term sheet, but I'm not sure I'll be done by 300, 
depending on this call.

Rail,'sent mail,"Since you both asked the same question, I thought I would send an email.

The little I know about rail is that the railroads control the contracts.  
You do it their way.

There is a lot of language in the LM contract concerning shipment, risk of 
loss, insurance, delivery.  I haven't thought through it all, but these 
issues probably need to be considered.   It may be best to work through GE on 
a change order basis to have them handle the shipment and storage elsewhere.  
Otherwise, we run the risk of having a dispute with them later about any 
problems or damage.  

I will be talking to GE this afternoon if you want the topic to be discussed 
then.

1. Which transformers go where?

2. How do we deal with the two cancelled units and any cancellation charges?

3. ABB has not had a good experience with an Enron LLC arrangement, and the 
contract allows for them to request payment security.  Unless they are 
convinced that they aren't at risk, they will want some form of payment 
security.  The contract does allow for the equipment to be paid off (except 
retainage) to facilitate the assignment.

Mike is available Thursday to discuss these issues, and how to get the break

Who from tax and accounting is reviewing this deal?

Is there a reason for member guaranties rather than equity funding agreements 
or note purchase agreements or any other structure?


Is a DASH/GASH prepared?

FCE/Confidential,'sent mail,"Hi Dan,

One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality 
agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The 
agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company 
from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we 
are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the 
exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  

FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on 
Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the 
general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.  
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.

I'm trying to include an exception for ""potential lenders and investors""

respect to any transaction that may be proposed or undertaken, including the

ESA equipment purchase,'sent mail,"Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.

Hi Sweetheart. Yes we did get a little rain this morning.Just glad to get

I made the changes you suggested. 

The prior version contained a non-circumvention (you can't pursue the project

additional participants.  I've changed language in the next paragraph to

Land Option,'sent mail,"Gentlemen,

Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land option 
agreement.  The most significant change is that it is clear that the option 
payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the purchase 
price.  There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re assignment) that the 
assignee remains responsible for any liability arising prior to assignment.  

I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.  Please 
advise if this version is acceptable.  Also, please let me know if you would 
like for me to have a redline version prepared.

on who the EPC contractor is.  I also thought the O&M affiliate was fatal

I received your voice mail regarding the ABB contract. As I recall, ABB 
signed the contract after I received approval from you (while we were on the 
phone on July 14 talking about the Moore project), Rose, and Herman, and had 
incorporated the comments sent by Rob Taylor. Quite frankly, I thought that 
was it for the GF approval process, so WestLB's comments came as a surprise 
to me when they were faxed in a few days later. 

I received a voice mail that indicated that ABB is ok with WestLB's changes. 
I expect Enron may be signing today, and we will need WestLB's signature.

4.  Change 100,000 to 50,000 (right, Fred?)

5.  Add ""and the purchase order or contract will be assigned to Customer (or 
Customer's designee) at Customer's request, including the warranty provisions

9.  Add ""for the purpose of performing its Scope of Work"" to the end of the

Gas supply for VEPCO project,'sent mail,"Hi Jeff,

Ozzie Pagan's team is working on a project for VEPCO.  The power plant will 
be located in Edgecombe County, North Carolina. I've been told that getting 
gas for the plant is a significant issue due to local gas supply conditions.  
One alternative has been to buy gas from the City of Rocky Mount, which has a 
take or pay contract with the local supplier, and is not using all of their 
gas, especially in the summer.  

We have developed a preliminary draft of the LOI, which I am attaching for 
your review.  I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss it with you to

I don't think that we will be using a weather hedge this season.

I am not as confident in the correlation in a closer to normal temperature environment which is the forecast for this winter.

re: Gas Daily options revaluation,'sent mail,"This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

Some of our employees in NY have asked whether we would be offering the same

Ultimately, it is a business cost, not an HR decision.  Metals reimburses up

Your schedules are very full so I went ahead and spoke to Mark F. about the 
drift budget for 2001 and my thoughts of keeping drift as a consolidated 
number (including Europe).  He agreed it would be easier for me to manage it 
in a single unit  and will get together with you and Dave D. for agreement.  
I suggested that he and all his managers get together with me if additional 
explanations are needed.

Hope this is satisfactory.

Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am 
putting together for EGM.  I would appreciate your comments on the 
presentation but especially need your input on your section.  The LNG page is 
on page 6 and needs some work.  there is also a typo.  On the graph, we need 
to find a way to illustrate our business graphically, what do you think?
 I would appreciate a quick turnaround of your initial changes.  After we 
complete this first draft, this will be a continuous work in progress.
Thanks,

Mr.McConnell,

I wanted to touch basis with you regarding your laptop tune-up last week and 
any issues that you may have had over the weekend. If there were any dialup 
issues or if you have any questions regarding our dialup process (VPN) please 
let me know. 

FYI,
Per our discussion last Wednesday your Compaq M300 (standard Enron issue) has 
been ordered and I will let you know when it is ready for use.

draft organization memo,'sent mail,"All,

Attached is the first draft of an EGM update and org memo.  Please take a few 
minutes and review, add what is necessary for your section and return ASAP.   
Other comments are welcome as well.    I would like to get this at on Friday 
evening or early next week.   Please do so on a hard copy and have brought 
up.  I will incorporate your changes. Some of the changes in the memo are 
still under consideration and need to be considered extremely confidential.  
This needs a lot of work and filler.  Also add a one line update or positive

Re: Car,'sent mail,"Steve,

Sorry for the slow response but I got the latest word on voicemail while out 
here in SF.  They completely screwed up my order, not Ron the guy from 
Mercedes USA, but the dealer.  Ron has stepped in and followed up himself and 
I'll be receiving a 2001 in late August/early Sept..  He is a good guy and is 
trying to make up for the major dropping of the ball.  My sales guy that blew 
it is no longer in that job.  Hopefully it will be coming soon.  I'll believe 
it when i see it but I am very excited and it was a real let down in June 
when it didn't' arrive.

Thanks for asking.

We'll talk soon.

Re: EnHome - Please review,'sent mail,"Suzanne,

I glanced at the presentation.  It looks good.  
Two comments:
1.  Could we use our older machines for home use?  They are still very good 
they just aren't the newest technology.  All are fast, CD ready  with plenty 
of memory.  It could knock the cost down significantly.
2.  I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.  That 
would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.  I recommend that 
you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.

Good luck.  Your teams hard work really shows here.

Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember

Playday!!,'sent mail,"Hi,

How's it going?  You realize we missed our PLAYDAY for the kids this week.  
We need to make sure we get on schedule for next week.  Sometimes the Tuesday

spend Wednesday recuperating (i.e. getting the boys and myself to bed 
early).  It's always so much better when Todd is not working and he can keep 
them.  

Girl, what did you think of that Jon P. Kee song that Joe and that girl were 
singing on Tuesday.  The choir really wasn't into that one.  We just could 
not muster up a good sound!   Are you going to the groundbreaking ceremony?

It was good to meet you last Thursday.  It is always fun to harass the NY
locals, even if it has to be done through a tele-conference camera.

Here is something to file away for future use, save the head-hunter fees and
give me a call direct the next time you are looking for a seasoned Nymex

relative that would do it for a $70 set up fee plus $5 per stump (approx 14
stumps). The tree man will deduct this off of what he owes us for the trees.

As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian

incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not 
being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are 
spelled correctly in all position files.

Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.  These guys mainly care about the gas 
pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to 
increase throughput.  These plants that they want on their lines are 
currently in construction or development.  Their only operational plants are 
in Colorado.  They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not 
want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as 
long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.  If you guys offered to 
buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and 
stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their 
projects to put on their lines.  Hope this helps.

RE: Admission Visit,'sent mail,"Meg:
I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT

disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a 
good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my 
work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able 
to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what 
I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.  Thanks

However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We

Re: Alberto Jimenez (Rotation),'sent mail,"Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

PNM,'sent mail,"Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument.  I did not go as far as I 
could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no 
limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what 
capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be 
less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this 
passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  

My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as ""firm"" or ""interruptible"" 
since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except 
to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM 
is comfortable with all this before we file anything.

Mr. & Mrs. T...,'sent mail,"Hey Lisa,

Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.

WT-1 Electric Service Agreement,'sent mail,"Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of

In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.  My sincerest apologies

Gallup certificate question,'sent mail,"Lorraine:  here's Keith's brief response to your question about increasing 
capacity without changing the service factor or making other mods to the 
Gallup compressor.  Let me know where we need to go from here.  
***
Susan, my understanding is that the capacity west to the California border is 
a certificated amount (1090 MMcf/d).  If in any way we try to change the 
certificated amount of capacity (firm capacity), we will need to file.  TW is 
different than NNG, in that TW certificates capacity rather than facilities.  
Arnold's idea of using a pressure commitment would still require a filing.  
Please let me know, if we need to discuss further.

Keith",664
certificate questions,'sent mail,"Keith, last week you and I discussed briefly Facilities Planning's proposal 
to change the service factor on the Gallup compressor in order to increase 
capacity.  I believe you had concluded that a certificate application would 
be necessary.  Now Arnold Eisenstein is asking me (thru our commercial 
people) whether we would still have to make a filing if our certificated 
capacity could be increased without any physical modification to the 
compressor -- in other words, through a pressure commitment.  My initial 
impression is yes, we would have to make a filing.  Am I out of my mind?  
Does this make sense?  Please advise.",632

question is that it totally depends on how Greg divided the community

case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and 
save a lot in taxes!  Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work:  I believe 
his number is 713-228-7401.  He's a nice guy and I believe him to be 
competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're 
doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise 
calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the 
best deal.  If I can find some other names/numbers for you, I will.  Hope 
this helps!",758

IT revenue crediting,'sent mail,"I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked

credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some 
refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue 
crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such 
obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the 
same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis.

here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with 
auctions?  Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on 
establishment of a reserve price, since it's difficult to tell what that is 
from the order.  A couple of times TW has stated a minimum bid in its IOS.

Sometimes the answers clarify themselves after you leave the question sitting 
out there a while...

As for the contract rights of replacement shippers, I would say the tariff 
language gives us some leeway on whether to automatically give replacement 
shipper the releasing shipper's discount at alt. points.  If we don't, and 
the replacement shipper uses an alt. point and has to pay max rate, releasing 
shipper gets a refund under our billing provision.  I know Lindy has some 
clear ideas on what we want here... we can discuss more if you like.  ",751

I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is

Also, regarding the language you crossed out at the bottom of paragraph 1

Re: another idea,'sent mail,"Julie,

Everything you have mentioned up to this point sounds incredible.  I would 
love to see the symphony, got to a polo match or the races, etc. etc.  I've 
made everybody here at work green with envy talking about my trip.  I'm going 
to email you back tomorrow with a much more detailed response to your emails 
because I'm trying like mad to get out of work before 7:00 tonight.  Anyway, 
like I said it all sounds great and I am very excited about the trip (believe 
me it's much needed).

Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she 
must be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact 
statement was ""If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have 
another talk"".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is 
probably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define 
the exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to 
leave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.

I was wondering if you would do me a favor.  You have sent a couple of 
packages to Jeff's home by UPS or FedEx.  Unfortunately, Jeff is never there 
to sign for them, so the packages are delayed in getting to him as we have to 
track them down.  UPS is very good about rerouting to the business address, 
but FedEx won't reroute without the permission of the sender (i.e., you).  

At any rate, in the future if you would send packages to Jeff at Enron Corp., 
1400 Smith Street, EB5008, Houston, Texas, 77002, I would really appreciate 
it.  And of course, anything marked ""confidential"" is opened only by him.

HR Position,'sent mail,"Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Hey,'sent mail,"Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested

several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from

Hi Kate,
Just checking on this deal.  Is this gonna be an exchange for physical and 
the counterparty name will be added later?  It's been ""new"" for a couple of 
days now, which is fine, I just wanted to make sure someone is working on it.

When I tried to verbally confirm this deal, the counterparty has this deal 
running for three months, December through February.  Could you check with 
the trader and either change it or have him talk to the counterparty about 
it.  Let me know.

idea and would be perfect for you. Now I think you should start taking steps 
to make it happen. I know you could get your house sold, no problem. And you 
should think seriously about putting it on the market soon, as I'm starting 
to get the feeling it can take quite a while to actually sell a house. Let me 
know how I can help - for example, Brian has some friends who rent out a 
great cottage in Kihei for $100 a week. He can also get really good deals on

Arizona Biltmore Spa Reservation,'sent mail,"I took a message from Pat Brown at Avista this morning. She needed to book

just like the facial. Please call Pat and confirm the reservation time when 
you make it. Her number is 509.495.8123. Thanks!

Changes to SAR Report,'sent mail,"Will - 

I've passed your phone number along to Bill Williams, the Real Time group 
manager here in Portland. He should be contacting you shortly to discuss 
problems with and changes to the Scheduling Activity Report. I've checked 
with other groups on the floor and found that the report is only used by Real 
Time, and less frequently by groups assisting Real Time, so I believe Bill or 
someone in his group could most suitably test the new application. Let me 
know if there's anything else I can do, and thanks for all your help today.

Re: #555410,'sent mail,"I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new 
Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of 
Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in 
this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will 
Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right 
term and volume now.

RE: Blazer Ticket Specials - March,'sent mail,"How did you know Steve Smith would be my first choice for a Blazer date? 
Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.

Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative 
assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the 
Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and 
stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths 
every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her. 

Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great

Kim:

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

Greg,
how are you?
Enclosed find some pictures from our regular sunday-night-Stammtisch.
Can you do me a favour and send me the email-adresses of James, Ben,
Glen, Mark and Ulrich. I want to invide them for the celebration of the
25th aniversary of the Stammtisch FKK. As you know this will happen from
20th of july until 22th of july 2001. I hope we see you there.
The email-adress on the top belongs to Hermann.

Take Care,

Greg,

I will be in Houston for a few days the week of the 11th of September.  I 
would appreciate your help as a career guidance counselor.  I would like 
-+30mins of your time on the afternoon of the 12th or the morning of the 13th 
of Sept.  If this works for you, have Liz contact me to set something up.  
Thanks, Don

Re: RedMeteor.com,'sent mail,"we currently have nothing working with redmeteor.   i have spoken with 
dicosmo a couple of times, but he has never seemed interested in persuing 
anything.  we would be willing to discuss an arrangement where enron posts 
some of its prices directly from EOL to redmeteor, but i question whether his 
technology is up to it.  we are entering into arrangements like this with 
other trading platforms.  there is certainly no reason to avoid talking to 
them, but i would suggest a conversation with Andy Zipper on the EOL team.  
he is the one that is handling these types of deals.  i will also forward 
your message to him.

thanks for the heads up
